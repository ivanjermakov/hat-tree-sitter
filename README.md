# hat-tree-sitter

Collection of Tree-sitter queries for [hat editor](https://github.com/ivanjermakov/hat).

## Reasoning

Nvim extends Tree-sitter predicates with [custom ones](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html#treesitter-predicates),
making queries made for nvim incompatible with pure Tree-sitter API.
